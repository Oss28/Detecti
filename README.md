# Detecti
Detecti serves as a semi-automatic tool, capable of examining specific sections of Solidity Smart Contracts code that may raise concerns for the
user (perhaps because of a dubious alert generated by another tool). Our primary objective is to scrutinize segments of the code that have triggered alerts
from other tools, with a clear emphasis on identifying potential false positives.
In rare instances, our aim is also to uncover possible false negatives.
