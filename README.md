# Detecti
Detecti serves as a semi-automatic tool, capable of examining specific sections of Solidity Smart Contracts code that may raise concerns for the
user (perhaps because of a dubious alert generated by another tool). 

Our primary objective is to scrutinize segments of the code that have triggered alerts from other tools, with a clear emphasis on identifying potential false positives.
In rare instances, our aim is also to uncover possible false negatives.

The need for such a tool arises from a problem common to most of the tools available to date for vulnerability analysis of Smart Contracts written in Solidity: the production of a considerable number of false positives.
